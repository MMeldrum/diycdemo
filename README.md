The **"Do It Yourself Console"** demo shows how easy it is to create a customized web console for JBoss AS7 Management.  It uses the [cli-resolver](https://github.com/ssilvert/cli-resolver) to bind JSF to the AS7 Management Model.  It also uses RichFaces for its slick components.  But any JSF component library will work.

See the [Getting Started Page](https://github.com/ssilvert/diycdemo/wiki/Getting-Started) for download / build / deploy info.

One of the interesting things about the demo is that it shows how much you can do with **no java code whatsover**.   [It's just markup.](https://github.com/ssilvert/diycdemo/blob/master/src/main/webapp/index.xhtml)
